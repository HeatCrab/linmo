/* Task Management and Scheduling
 *
 * Provides a lightweight task model with shared address space and
 * efficient round-robin scheduling. The scheduler uses the master task
 * list with optimized algorithms for better performance than naive O(n)
 * implementations, while maintaining simplicity and compatibility.
 *
 * The scheduler provides O(n) complexity but with small constant factors
 * and excellent practical performance for typical embedded workloads.
 * Priority-aware time slice allocation ensures good responsiveness.

 *
 * Task priorities are encoded in a 16-bit value with simplified mapping:
 * - Bits 15-8: Base Priority (Static) - mapped to priority level 0-7
 * - Bits  7-0: Time Slice Counter - decremented each tick when running
 *
 * Lower base priority values mean higher priority (level 0 = highest).
